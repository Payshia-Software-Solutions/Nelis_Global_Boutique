                Nelis Pvt Ltd was founded in 2018 with a simple yet powerful vision â€“ to bring the finest natural herbal teas and dehydrated fruits to the world while empowering local communities. What started as a home-based venture has now grown into a certified manufacturing company, recognized for quality and sustainability.

                Our founder, Nelka Hewage, was inspired by her work with rural communities and her experience in food technology. She saw an opportunity to reduce food waste, create employment for women, and promote Sri Lanka&apos;s rich agricultural heritage through high-quality, chemical-free products.
